## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or later recommended) - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository) - [Download](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Nosdesk.git
   cd Nosdesk
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To compile and hot-reload the application for development:
```sh
npm run dev
```
This launches the development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).

## Type Support
`Nosdesk` uses TypeScript for robust type checking. By default, TypeScript does not handle type information for `.vue` imports. To enable full type support:
- Use **[Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)** in your IDE for `.vue` type awareness.
- Replace the standard `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking in your terminal:
  ```sh
  npx vue-tsc --noEmit
  ```
